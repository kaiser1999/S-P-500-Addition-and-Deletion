This repository meticulously records the **additions** and **deletions** of stocks listed in the Standard & Poor's 500 (S&P 500) index.

# Background

I am currently compiling a comprehensive historical list of **S&P 500** component changes, complete with corresponding dates. This endeavor stems from the realization that such detailed information isn't freely available online.

Notably, the section titled "_Selected changes to the list of S&P 500 components_" on Wikipedia contains inaccuracies, and its historical versions under "View history" are similarly unreliable.

Other sources for a comprehensive historical list:
1. "_S&P 500 Historical Components & Changes.csv_" provided by [fja05680](https://github.com/fja05680/sp500)
2. "_The Price Response to S&P 500 Index Additions and Deletions: Evidence of Asymmetry and a New Explanation_" provided by [Honghui Chen, Gregory Noronha, and Vijay Singal](https://afajof.org/supplements/)
3. "_S&P Releases List of 86 Companies in the S&P 500 Since 1957_" provided by [PaperMoney](https://www.globalpapermoney.com/s-p-releases-list-of-86-companies-in-the-s-p-500-since-1957-cms-1023)
